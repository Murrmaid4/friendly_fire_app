Friendly Fire is a gamer based dating and friend finding application.


To use:

Git clone to your machine (in terminal in VSCode, use git clone and then copy the link from github and it will download the repo to your desktop)

if already cloned to machine, make sure to git pull on the main branch before making any changes

To create a new branch, use git checkout -b < nameofbranch > in terminal

git switch main will bring you back to the main branch (git switch nameofbranch will take you to other branches)

Once changes are made, merge the changes to the main branch 

Any questions? Send me(Brandi) a message! 


No changes should be made in the html file unless its meta-data or favicon images, all changes for app creation should be made in src folder

There are a few extensions in VSCode that can help make programming go a little faster, tabnine is great it can autocomplete for you, there are a few React based extensions like "ES7 React/Redux snippets" and "simple React Snippets", Prettier is great for formatting if you don't already have that extension as well.
