// For this page I was thinking we can put all the registration questions and inputs on this one page, but adding javascript elements to show and hide questions when users select the next button




// this page is what pulls up after users select sign up now


//set up the registration page with standard headline, registration components beneath


// Setting up your profile header text here



// what is your preferred name text and input field type

// When is your birthday and date selection input



// next button, which should be its own component that can be reused



// I identify as question with multiple choice answers


// show on profile toggle (make a component for reusability)

// next button component

// What is your ethnicity should be checkbox options




// What are you looking for multiple choice buttons

// depending on time, may not be able to do every section on registration form but can get the base information done
